Python code for different programms 
# 1     Write a function intreverse(n) that takes as input a positive integer n and returns the integer obtained by reversing the digits in n.

    Here are some examples of how your function should work.

    >>> intreverse(783)
    387
    >>> intreverse(242789)
    987242
    >>> intreverse(3)
    3

  #2 Write a function matched(s) that takes as input a string s and checks if the brackets "(" and ")" in s are matched: that is, every "(" has a matching ")" after it and every ")" has a matching "(" before it.  Your function should ignore all other symbols that appear in s.  Your function should return True if s has matched brackets and False if it does not.

    Here are some examples to show how your function should work.

    >>> matched("zb%78")
    True
    >>> matched("(7)(a")
    False
    >>> matched("a)*(?")
    False
    >>> matched("((jkl)78(A)&l(8(dd(FJI:),):)?)")
    True
# 3.Write a function sumprimes(l) that takes as input a list of integers and retuns the sum of all the prime numbers in l.

    Here are some examples to show how your function should work.

    >>> sumprimes([3,3,1,13])
    19
    >>> sumprimes([2,4,6,9,11])
    13
    >>> sumprimes([-3,1,6])
    0
